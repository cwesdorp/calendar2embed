# Calendar2Embed

Calendar generator capable of adding recurring markers using the URL query
string as input. This solution was created to add calendar view in
an easy way to content systems as wikis that support iframe content.

The solution is provided as is. It solves a problem for me and at this
moment doesn't need a lot more flexibility. If you like the solution
you're free to use it (or fork it) and give it a star ;-).

The code is straigh forward and not created for extensibility. Most magic
happens around the handling or markers to highlight dates. It needs one
external dependency Luxon that helps with date calculations.
